Python for Informatics course repository

Test repository as a first go.
Focus is to store any python I may find useful from the coursera course:
An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 1)
Link: https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython1 

The course uses a web-based tool called CodeSkulptor, but just in case there are examples of code which I would like to refer back to at a later date, this would be a good lace to store that code.
